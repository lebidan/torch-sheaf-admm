"""Sheaf-ADMM: learning multi-agent coordination via sheaf-constrained ADMM.

A differentiable optimization framework. An input is decomposed into overlapping
local views, each processed by an agent that solves a convex subproblem
parameterized by a shared neural encoder. Agents coordinate through ADMM with
inter-agent constraints specified by a cellular sheaf, and a shared decoder maps
the final agent states back to a global prediction. The whole pipeline is
differentiable and trained end-to-end.

Unofficial educational PyTorch port of "Learning Multi-Agent Coordination via
Sheaf-ADMM" (ICML 2026). The original JAX implementation is maintained by
Sakana AI at https://github.com/SakanaAI/sheaf-admm.
